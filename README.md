# Flatfile Listeners Tutorial Code

This repository contains companion code for the [Flatfile Coding Tutorial](https://flatfile.com/docs/coding-tutorial/overview), providing working examples that demonstrate how to build powerful data import listeners step by step.

## How This Repository Works

This repository is designed to be used alongside the [Flatfile Coding Tutorial](https://flatfile.com/docs/coding-tutorial/overview). The tutorial progressively walks you through building a complete listener, and this repository provides the corresponding code for each step.

Each folder represents a different stage in the tutorial:

- **`101.01-first-listener/`** - Learn the basics: space configuration and workbook setup
- **`101.02-adding-validation/`** - Add data validation with real-time feedback
- **`101.03-adding-actions/`** - Create interactive workflows with submit actions

## Prerequisites

- Basic JavaScript or TypeScript knowledge
- Node.js and npm installed (latest LTS version recommended)

## Getting Started

1. Follow the [Flatfile Coding Tutorial](https://flatfile.com/docs/coding-tutorial/overview) for step-by-step instructions
2. Use the code in each folder as reference or as a starting point
3. Each folder contains both TypeScript and JavaScript versions for your preference

## Structure

Each example folder contains:

- `typescript/` - TypeScript source code with full type safety
- `javascript/` - JavaScript version for those preferring vanilla JS

## Tutorial Progression

The tutorial teaches you to build a complete data import solution by:

1. **Starting simple** - Basic space and workbook configuration
2. **Adding intelligence** - Email validation and error handling  
3. **Creating workflows** - Submit actions and data processing

By the end, you'll have a production-ready listener that can handle real-world data import scenarios.
